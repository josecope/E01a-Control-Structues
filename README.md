# E01a-Control-Structues

Hello!  This file holds the first exercise we performed in class.

For the exercise, we were required to answer questions about 10 different files.  These questions were meant to teach us part of the basic formatting and style of coding used with this program.

The exercise also demonstrated the logical pathways that commands use to make a program function.

Thanks for Reading!
